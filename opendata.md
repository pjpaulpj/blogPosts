# Data wants to be open

Do you want to cure disease? Do you want scientists to have access to the data they need to cure diseases? If you answered yes to these questions, then you should be concerned about scientific publications and copyright.

I have been following the open access movement for the past few years (as I'm sure many of you have), and I am convinced that research results should be accessible to everyone to read, even if it is not necessarily immediately (although the sooner the better). Of course, someone needs to pay for that to happen, the research output have to be hosted somewhere, and there has to be certainty that it will be there for a long time, etc, etc, etc.

However, I have also been following publications in machine learning that attempt to summarize the state of molecular biology by text processing of the literature. This has been going on for a while, and from what I can gather, is getting better and better (recent examples [1](), [2]()). What is disturbing about these efforts is that so much information is locked away behind publisher silos. Even though papers resulting from government grants (and many other grants) must be submitted to a repository such as PubMed Central (PMC), the original copyright on the articles still applies, and the full text is therefore not available for machine learning.

# R Interface for Teaching


[Kaitlin Thaney](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=kaythaney&tw_i=354635159447941120&tw_p=tweetembed) asked on Twitter last week about using [Ramnath Vaidyanathan's](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=ramnath_vaidya&tw_i=354599459868508160&tw_p=tweetembed) new `interactive R notebook` [1](http://ramnathv.github.io/rNotebook/) [2](https://github.com/ramnathv/rNotebook) for teaching.

Now, to be clear up front, I am **not** trying to be mean to Ramnath, discredit his work, or the effort that went into that project. I think it is really cool, and has some rather interesting potential applications, but I don't really think it is the right interface for teaching `R`. Keep reading to find out why.

First, I believe Ramnath when he says he was inspired by the [`iPython Notebook`](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) that makes it so very nice to do interactive, reproducible Python coding. Software Carpentry

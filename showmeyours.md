# Response to "show me yours I'll show you mine"

romunov at ["danganothererror"][dLink] recently posted about his personal
setup for working with [R][dLink2], and challenged others to post as well. So here
is mine.

I use [RStudio][rLink1], maximized on one monitor (I have a two monitor setup).
This gives me multiple editor windows for scripts / function writing / package development,
an integrated R command window, workspace & history browser, as well as files, plots,
packages, and help. For working on multiple projects, I use the RStudio project
feature, that keeps project specific information (directory, saved sessions if you
want it, integrated git repos), and multiple desktops using [dexpot][dexLink] on 
Windows.

RStudio also has markdown to html support directly, and they are adding a bunch of
package development support, using a lot of the work Hadley Wickham has done with
the excelent **devtools** package.

I like it a lot, and much prefer it over my previous Notepad++, npptoR, R gui setup.

# Writing up scientific results and `knitr`

As an academic researcher, my primary purpose is to find some new insight, and subsequently communicate this insight to the general public. The process of doing this is traditionally thought to be:

  1. from observations of the world, generate a hypothesis
  * design experiments to test hypothesis
  * analyse results of the experiments to determine if hypothesis correct
  * write report to communicate results to others (academics and / or general public)

And then repeat.

This is the way people envision it happening. And I would imagine that in some rare cases, this is what actually happens. However, I think many researchers would agree that this is not what normally happens. In the process of doing steps **3** and **4**, your hypothesis in **1** will be modified, which modifies the experiments in **2**, and so on and so forth. This makes the process of scientific discovery a very iterative process, often times right up to the report writing. 

For some of this, it takes a long time to figure this out. I'll never forget a professor during my PhD who suggested that you write the paper, and then figure out what experiments you should do to generate the results that would support or disprove the hypothesis you made in the paper. At the time I thought he was nuts, but when you start writing stuff, and looking at how all the steps of experiment and reporting can become intertwined, it doesn't seem like a bad idea. <font size="3"><a href="note1">note1</a></font>

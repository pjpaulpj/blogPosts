# Writing up scientific results

As an academic researcher, my primary purpose is to find some new insight, and subsequently communicate this insight to the general public. The process of doing this is traditionally thought to be:

  * from observations of the world, generate a hypothesis
  * design experiments to test hypothesis
  * analyse results of the experiments to determine if hypothesis correct
  * write report to communicate results to others (academics and / or general public)

And then repeat.
